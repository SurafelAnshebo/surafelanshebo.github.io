# **[Personal website] - GitHub Pages Site**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the source code for my personal GitHub Pages site, built using Jekyll, a static site generator. The site showcases my portfolio/projects/resume.

### **Built with Jekyll**
Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. 

## **Using the Template**
This site was built using a Jekyll template originally created by [ldery](https://github.com/ldery/ldery.github.io). I have customized it for my own use.
